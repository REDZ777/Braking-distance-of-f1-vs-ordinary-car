# Braking-distance-of-f1-vs-ordinary-car

The braking distance, also called the stopping distance, is the distance a vehicle covers from the time of the full application of its brakes until it has stopped moving. This is often given as a 100-0kph distance.

In the web application braking distance of f1 and ordinary car is calculated based on following variables speed of the vehicle, coefficient of friction, reaction time of the driver, and aerodynamic downforce(G's). Typically for a ordinary car the aerodynamic downforce is 9.81(single G) but for formula one cars aerodynamic downforce enables tremendous deceleration: 4.5 G's to 5.0 G's (44 to 49 m/s2), and up to 5.5 G's (54 m/s2) at the high-speed circuits such as the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve (Canadian GP) and the Autodromo Nazionale Monza (Italian GP). This contrasts with 1.0 G's to 1.5 G's (10 to 15 m/s2) for the best sports cars (the Bugatti Veyron is claimed to be able to brake at 1.3 g). An F1 car can brake from 200 km/h (124 mph) to a complete stop in just 2.9 seconds, using only 65 metres (213 ft).

FORMULA FOR CALCULATION
**Stopping distance of f1 = Velocityf1*(1000/3600))^2 / (2*Coeff1*9.8*G) + (Velocityf1*reaction_timef1))** remove g in the formula for ordinary car
